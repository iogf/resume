Personal Projects
=================

**Sukhoi**

Project site: https://github.com/untwisted/sukhoi

Notes: I have designed and implemented this micro web crawler framework.
I have built it on top of Untwisted framework which is meant to ease
the implementation of networking applications. It also uses Websnake
which is a library to perform asynchronous http/https requests.

**Untwisted**

Project site: https://github.com/untwisted/untwisted

Notes: I have designed and implemented this event-driven framework
whose main goal is implementing networking applications under
an asynchronous model. It also is useful to reduce the complexity
of dealing with some internet protocols.

**Crocs**

Project site: https://github.com/iogf/crocs

Notes: I have designed and implemented this framework to
increase creativity when dealing with regex's. It also is meant
to reduce errors and improve testing of regex's.

**Websnake**

Project site: https://github.com/untwisted/websnake

Notes: I have designed and implemented this library
whose purpose is performig http/https requests in an asynchronous manner.

**Vy**

Project site: https://github.com/vyapp/vy

Notes: I have designed and implemented this Editor/IDE on top of
Python Tkinter package. I have also used Untwisted framework, 
python Jedi auto completion package, golang Gocode auto completion engine 
among other tools to develop some of Vy plugins. Vy is meant to be a
vim-like written in python, flexible and highly programmable.

Work Experience
===============

**Arcamens**

Project site: https://arcamens.com/

Notes: I have helped to design and implement this project management platform 
whose main goal is to be highly flexible and effortless for teams  which deal with 
high amount of tasks due to the powerful aggregated concepts  which includes a total 
new way of visualizing kanban boards and usage of cut/paste  instead of dragging/dropping. 
The platform was built on top of the robust web framework Django.  We have used rabbitmq, 
bootstrap, javascript. I have helped to design a module to deliver Web Pushs notification 
through https://onesignal.com as well.
