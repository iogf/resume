is allowing people to get help and help others. I have developed it entirely using
Python/Django and HTML5/Bootstrap4.

increase creativity/productivity when dealing with regex patterns. It also is meant
to reduce errors and improve testing of regex patterns.

Notes: A parser whose goal is offering a powerful mechanism to handle complex parsing problems.
It also offers a flexible lexer which makes it handy to tokenize complex structures.

**WebSnake**

Notes: I designed and implemented entirely WebSnake that is an aiohttp alternative. It allows
to perform multiple HTTP/HTTPS requests in parallel. There is built-in support for basic authorization
and also token based authorization.


**Sukhoi**

https://github.com/untwisted/sukhoi

Notes: I have designed and implemented this micro web crawler framework.
I have built it on top of Untwisted framework which is meant to ease
the implementation of networking applications. It also uses Websnake
which is a library to perform asynchronous http/https requests.

**Vy**

https://github.com/vyapp/vy

Notes: I have designed and implemented this Editor/IDE on top of
Python Tkinter package. I have also used Untwisted framework, 
python Jedi auto completion package, golang Gocode auto completion engine 
among other tools to develop some of Vy plugins. Vy is meant to be a
vim-like written in python, flexible and highly programmable.
